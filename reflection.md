What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I struggled with some technicality in the homework, especially when it came to the methods. I was unsure what arguments to give each method, especially when it came to using the Computer class in the ResaleShop methods. I was first trying to do computer:object or computer:class, I then asked a friend of mine and she told me that Computer from Computer.py is a type that I can give my arguments. This then fixed many of my problems.

An advice I would give someone taking this course in the future is to activate the AutoSave settings. Everytime I was trying to run my main() function, the terminal would always output the same thing no matter what I changed. And then I realized that it was because the changes I made to other files were not saved. This setting can save you a lot of confusion and time.
